## SELF GUIDED
### 💥🚀 Goal 💥🚀
This activity is focused on gaining experience by doing exercises. Remember, practice makes perfect so try to do your best to solve the following challenges. If you get stuck, you can always go back to the previously covered lessons or do a Google search.

### 📋💬 Instructions 📋💬
For this challenge, you are to build out a Basic Calculator. This is to be done without the use of any additional libraries or frameworks. 

## ✍🏻 Mandatory ✍🏻
As you are working through this challenge, please keep in mind the following:

You must create the HTML and CSS from scratch. However, please feel free to keep this to a minimum.

Use the calculator image for hints as to what functionality should come with the basic Calculator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, equals,  and clear).

Entering numbers followed by any mathematical operator should store the number on the screen as well as clear the screen so the user can enter new numbers to complete the rest of the equation. Additionally, upon hitting the equals button, the screen should clear once again and only display the result.

Anything not listed in the instructions/notes is open for your own interpretation.
